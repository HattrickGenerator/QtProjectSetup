# QtProjectSetup
A project for using 3D GUI features.


In the current project status the basic setup is done. 

The whole Project is designed to be cross platform compatible (by using CMake), although currently only tested on a Linux system.

A library is created to which the main exectuable links to.
Features can be tested using the google test framework that automatically downloads and install itself on the first CMake run.
